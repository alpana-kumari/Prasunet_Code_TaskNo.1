# Population Distribution Visualization with Tableau

Goal: The goal of this project is to create a bar chart using Tableau to visualize the average population distribution of each country from 1960 to 2023.

Step 1: Download the Dataset
  Download the necessary dataset from the World Bank website:
  Dataset URL: World Bank Population Dataset

Step 2: Connect Dataset with Tableau
  Import the downloaded dataset into Tableau for analysis and visualization.

Step 3: Load Necessary Table
  Load the dataset into a Tableau worksheet for data manipulation and visualization.

Step 4: Data Processing
  Perform necessary data processing steps:
  Calculate the average population ("AVG") for each country from 1960 to 2023.
  Formula: AVG = AVERAGE(E2:BP2) (adjust the row index as needed for each country)

Step 5: Create a Bar Graph
  Create a bar chart to visualize the average population distribution:
    Drag and drop the "Country Code" field to the column shelf.
    Drag and drop the "Average population" column to the row shelf.

  Use "Country Name" as a tooltip for additional details.
  
  Visualization Details
    Customize the bar chart in Tableau to enhance clarity and visual appeal.
    Ensure the chart includes appropriate labels, axes, and a title to convey the intended message effectively.
